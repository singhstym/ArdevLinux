## Todo
Ardev Linux is focusing more on improving its already existing packages and features instead of adding more plugins.
Things we are currently working and actively looking for contributions on:
- Add [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) as an option for Window Manager
- Include more theme options
- Include more font options
